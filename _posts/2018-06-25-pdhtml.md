There is a super easy way to scrap tabular data from websistes, it isn't beautiful soup library, it's easier! The Pandas library has a built-in method to scrape tabular data from html pages called **read_html()**. Reading the pandas documentation (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.22/generated/pandas.read_html.html) this function searches for ``<table>`` elements and only for ``<tr>`` and ``<th>`` rows and ``<td>`` elements within each ``<tr>`` or ``<th>`` element in the table.

I usually use this function to get data from tables in Wikipedia articles. 

LetÂ´s see an example:
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_html('https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states')
```
